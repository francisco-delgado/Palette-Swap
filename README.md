Palette-Swap
============

Takes the pixels from a picture and reorders them to create another picture

## Dependencies

This script requires the Python PIL package which can be downloaded here http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pillow for Windows

## Usage

Input the path to the source picture, destination picture, and the time (in seconds) you want to run the program for. 2.5 minutes is good enough. If there aren't enough pixels in the source picture then random colors will be used instead and if the source picture is larger than the destination picture then the only the first pixels will be used
